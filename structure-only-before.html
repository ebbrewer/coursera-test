        <h1>HTML is Structure Only</h1>
        <p>HTML provides the structure of the webpage. It tells everyting where it should go just like a document. Without HTML, the webpage wouldn't know where everything goes.</p>
        <p>Now I'm just trying to think of random things to say to go here. What a great template.</p>
